Given an abstract class Quadrilateral, create subclasses Parallelogram, Rhombus, Rectangle, and Square, which implement the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods correctly.

Note: You can look into the stub file to figure out what is the input we are taking and the output we are producing.

Sample Input :
5.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 8.0 4.0 9.0
Expected Output:
Parallelogram Perimeter: 18.0
Parallelogram Area: 15.0
Rhombus Perimeter: 20.0
Rhombus Area: 20.0
Rectangle Perimeter: 24.0
Rectangle Area: 32.0
Square Perimeter: 36.0
Square Area: 81.0
